Summary of App Requirements and Goals:
The inventory management app was developed to help users efficiently track and manage their inventory items. The primary goal of the app was to provide a user-friendly interface where users could easily add, update, and delete inventory items, ensuring they have a clear overview of their stock levels at all times. The app addresses the need for a simple, accessible way to manage inventory without the complexity of traditional inventory management systems.

Screens and Features to Support User Needs:
The app includes several key screens to support user needs, such as the login/register screen, the inventory display screen, and the SMS notification screen. The login/register screen allows users to securely log in or create an account, ensuring that only authorized users can access the inventory data. The inventory display screen is designed with a grid layout to provide a clear and concise view of all inventory items, along with their quantities. Users can easily add new items, update existing items, or remove items as needed. The SMS notification screen enables users to set up alerts for low inventory levels, helping them stay on top of their stock without constantly monitoring the app.

Approach to Coding the App:
In developing the app, I focused on creating a strong and maintainable codebase using modular programming practices. I began by establishing a SQLite database to store inventory data and user credentials securely. Each feature was implemented as a separate module, allowing for easier updates and debugging. The app's UI components were built using Android's layout tools to ensure a responsive and intuitive design. Moving forward, these strategies will be invaluable in building scalable and maintainable applications.

Testing for Functionality:
To ensure the app was fully functional, I utilized the Android Emulator to test each feature thoroughly. This testing process included verifying that users could log in and out, add, update, and delete inventory items, and receive SMS notifications based on specific conditions. Testing is critical in identifying bugs and ensuring a smooth user experience. It helped reveal issues that needed fixing and confirmed that the app met all user requirements.

Innovation and Challenges:
One of the main challenges in developing this app was integrating the SMS notification feature while managing user permissions dynamically. Ensuring the app could handle permission requests smoothly and function correctly even when permissions were denied required innovative solutions and careful coding. Additionally, designing a user-friendly interface that clearly displayed inventory data and provided intuitive controls for managing items was another area that required thoughtful design and testing.

Successful Component:
The most successful component of the app was the inventory management functionality itself. The ability to easily add, update, and delete items directly from the inventory display screen provided users with a straightforward and efficient way to manage their stock. This component showcased my ability to create a functional, user-centered UI and effectively implement database management skills, resulting in an app that meets the needs of its users.
